# Introduction

Welcome to the to.photo API! You can use our API to access to.photo API endpoints, which will serve you 24/7 with beautiful, high quality photo products.

# Authentication

to.photo uses Basic Auth to allow access to the API. To get new Basic Auth Credentials contact your personal Key Account Manager.

to.photo expects for the Basic Auth to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: yourkeyhere`
